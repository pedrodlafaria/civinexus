# Civinexus

New paradigms and models for Governance&Politics, Economics&Finance, Business, Law&Justice will be essential in empowering us to tackle current and future issues such as economic inequality, climate change, sustainability, political transparency, automation, jobs, as well as many others that need collective coordinated action.

Software can play a central role in enabling the needed changes. This overarching project is meant to be a testbed for several different ideas. The goal is to use this repository to host many different prototypes that showcase the application of any new idea and/or model related to the aforementioned subjects. The application will usually take the form of a web, mobile or desktop appplication. 

The repository is currently under construction. Existing projects will be added soon. The corresponding github-pages website https://pedrodlafaria.github.io/civinexus/ is also being built.

The meetup https://www.meetup.com/Society-2-0/ is to be used to discuss this project.
